-- in batch training, gradients for each example calculated seperately and every weight will be updated by its average gradient. 

for example

If your model has 5 weights and you have a mini-batch size of 2 then you might get this:

Example 1. Loss=2, gradients=(1.5,−2.0,1.1,0.4,−0.9)
Example 2. Loss=3, gradients=(1.2,2.3,−1.1,−0.8,−0.7)

The average of the gradients in this mini-batch are calculated, they are (1.35,0.15,0,−0.2,−0.8)
