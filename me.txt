I am an X (I don't even actually now what I am) who interested in various things.

I am the one who interested in/passed through various things in the graph.
More historically,
I lived in Istanbul Ataturk High School of Science for 4 years.
I started to find robotics interesting at first year of high school.
I met with programming (wasn't even know what it is), built some robots, met with
PID as result of a need. On third and fourth grade, we've worked on our race car as a
team which born from the ground. I was started to thinking like "Wow, it's so nice to
having a racing team, so nice to crafting a car that we've designed on SolidWorks, so nice to
having a garage that I can hug my car inside of it lol"

After graduation, I started Control and Automation Engineering at Istanbul Technical
University. As a race lover, continued to the story with ITU Facilis Racing Team.
Also started to working as an Embedded Software Developer at embdlab, date was Jan 2018.
I have started to learning about learning (I mean Deep Learning) as a hobby these days.

We've been accepted to Shell Eco-Marathon '18. At the end of the spring term,
we went to London for racing at SEM'18. Competition was so nice and that's all,
if its nice its nice.
